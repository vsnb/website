It should actually be even less scary than we think to start a company or a project and compete against any of those huge tech companies.

A lot has be spoken and written about how the big tech is slow to iterate due to their
internal policies, structure and politics.

I think what is less known (or less discussed, at least) is the fact that you'd rarely be competing against the entire company, unless your project is one of their "core"
niches such as video streaming services, search, actual physical cloud infrastructure or a
substantial physical product that requires heavy capital.

You will likely be up against a small team of 6-12, responsible for a service/tool/product. Those people are not very motivated due to all the big company reasons. But the
key here is that they are also small. On top of that, people on the inside rarely have
the career luxury of working on a single fancy thing. They typically have other projects, toil, oncalls, trainings, mandates, horisontals, verticals and managers to deal with, etc, etc.

P.S. Having that, I'm unlikely to deliver shit, based on years of observing myself working for a big tech company. The silver (wouldn't call it a gold one) cage is hard to escape from.
