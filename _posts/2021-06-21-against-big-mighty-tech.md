It should actually be even less scary starting a company or a project which would compete
aginst those huge tech companies.

A lot has be spoken and written about how the big tech is slow to iterate due to their
internal policies, structure and politics.

I think what is less known (or discussed, at least) is the fact that you'd rarely be competing against the entire bloody company. Unless your project is one of their "core"
niches such as a video streaming service, search, actual physical cloud infrastructure, etc.

You will likely be up against a small team of 6-12, responsible for a service/tool/product. Those people are not very motivated due to all the mentioned big company reasons. But the
key here is that they are also a small. On top of that, people on the inside rerely have
the career luxury of working on a single fancy thing. They typically have other projects, toil, oncalls, trainings, mandates, horisontals, verticals and managers to deal with, etc, etc.
