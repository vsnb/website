How many bits of data can a typical room with all objects in it store?
Objects have classes, types, spacial position and orientation, colour, texture, relative position (to each other). Objects have states.

A face of a stopped wall clock stores log2(12^2) ~= 9 bits.

Plant and landscape a garden which stores your RSA key.

Devise a code based on words, make a song and sing it across many generations
of humans (like we used to preserve information) but store digital data.

Large artificially planted forests for big data banks, some trees are used
for error correction codes.

```shell
mvi r0, #0
jmp r0
```
