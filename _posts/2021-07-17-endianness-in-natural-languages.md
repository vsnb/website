Information has no spacial aspect to it but we format textual representation
on a 2-dimensional plane. This brings a question of Endianness: Western
language are written left to right.

In English-speaking countries (and I assume some others as well), postal
addresses are little-endian: you go from unit to building to suburb, etc ->
from most specific to least specific, from least to most significant.

Positional numbers however are weird: they're big-endian. Probably because
of the region(s) they came from and their right-to-left languages, I'm not sure.

What I am sure is that 2021 should actually be represented as 1202. However,
some dipshits in the past decided otherwise (if they even ever gave it a thought at all).
